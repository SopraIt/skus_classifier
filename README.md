## Scope
This is a machine learning (ML) project aimed to classify SKUs basing on the catalog images for that particular brand. Custom snapshots can also be used to classify the SKU.

### Problem
The whole system is a supervised binary classifier: the catalog images, associated by related SKU id, compose the training set.
In order to allow more freedom when taking snapshots, the training set is normalized and segmented.
